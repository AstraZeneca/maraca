This vignette is largely based on the

```

When using a maraca plot in a regulatory setting, for example to visualize clinical
study results for regulatory submissions, there will be strict validation demands.
For example, the results might need to be double programmed for validation purposes.

In order to facilitate the validation of the graphic output, the maraca package 
includes the function `validate_maraca_plot()` that allows the user to extract important
metrics from the plot itself. This allows to programmatically compare the results
of a plot produced using the maraca package with other programmatic approaches. The
paper linked above walks through a validation example where the double programming
was done in SAS.

To use the validation functionality, we need to first create a maraca object.
```{r maraca1, eval = TRUE}
library(maraca)

data(hce_scenario_a)

maraca_dat <- maraca(
  data = hce_scenario_a,
  step_outcomes = c("Outcome I", "Outcome II", "Outcome III", "Outcome IV"),
  last_outcome = "Continuous outcome",
  fixed_followup_days = 3 * 365,
  column_names = c(outcome = "GROUP", arm = "TRTP", value = "AVAL0"),
  arm_levels = c(active = "Active", control = "Control"),
  compute_win_odds = TRUE
)
```

We then create a maraca plot and save the actual plot as an object.
```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
# Save plot as its own object
maraca_plot <- plot(maraca_dat)
# The plot has its own class called "maracaPlot"
class(maraca_plot)
# Display plot
maraca_plot
```
Now we can validate the plot using the `validate_maraca_plot()` function.
```{r}
validation_list <- validate_maraca_plot(maraca_plot) 
# Display which metrics are included
str(validation_list)
```

Running the `validate_maraca_plot()` function on a maraca plot object returns a list
with the following items:

1. `plot_type`: depending on which `density_plot_type` was selected for the plot either
`GeomPoint`, `GeomViolin` and/or `GeomBoxplot`
2. `proportions`: the proportions of the HCE components
3. `tte_data`: the time-to-event data
4. `scatter_data`: if plot was created with `density_plot_type = "scatter"` then contains 
dataset that was plotted in scatter plot, otherwise `NULL`  
5. `boxstat_data`: if plot was created with `density_plot_type = "box"` or
`density_plot_type = "default"` then contains the boxplot statistics, otherwise `NULL`
6. `violin_data`: if plot was created with `density_plot_type = "violin"` or
`density_plot_type = "default"` then contains the violin distribution data, otherwise `NULL`
7. `wo_stats`: if maraca object was created with `compute_win_odds = TRUE` then contains 
the win odds statistics, otherwise `NULL`


These can then be converted to a convenient format for validation, such as as individual
data.frames.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

validation_list$proportions %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rename("proportion" = ".")

head(validation_list$tte_data)

validation_list$boxstat_data %>%
 unnest_wider(outliers, names_sep = "") %>%
 pivot_longer(., cols = -group, names_to = "stat_name", values_to = "values") %>%
 filter(!is.na(values)) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

head(validation_list$violin_data)

validation_list$wo_stats
```
