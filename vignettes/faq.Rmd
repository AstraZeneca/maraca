# I get a warning "Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point)." when plotting using density_plot_type scatter.

This happens because when using scatter, some points are jittered and may end up
visually outside of the plotting range, so they can't be displayed.
That warning informs you (in a cryptic way) of this fact. Given that the
jittering is randomised, sometimes you might get that warning, sometimes you
won't, even for the same input.

If you want to silence the warning, use suppressWarning() when you print
the plot for displaying.
