\title{Creates and returns the plot of the maraca data.}
\usage{
plot_maraca(
  obj,
  continuous_grid_spacing_x = 10,
  trans = "identity",
  density_plot_type = "default",
  vline_type = "median",
  theme = "maraca"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{an object of S3 class 'maraca'}

\item{continuous_grid_spacing_x}{The spacing of the x grid to use for the
continuous section of the plot.}

\item{trans}{the transformation to apply to the data before plotting.
The accepted values are the same that ggplot2::scale_x_continuous}

\item{density_plot_type}{which type of plot to display in the continuous
part of the plot. Options are "default", "violin", "box", "scatter".}

\item{vline_type}{what the vertical lines in the continuous part of the plot
should highlight. Options are "median", "mean", "none".}

\item{theme}{Choose theme to style the plot. The default theme is "maraca".
Options are "maraca", "maraca_old", "color1", "color2" and none".
For more details, check the vignette called

object for it to be displayed.
