\alias{component_plot.maraca}
\title{Generic function to create a plot showing the components used in
calculating win odds (wins and ties) separately for each
outcome directly from a maraca object.
Note that for this plot, when creating the maraca object using the maraca()
function, the argument "compute_win_odds" has to be set to TRUE.
Check the vignette "Plotting win odds" for more details.}
\usage{
\method{component_plot}{maraca}(x, theme = "maraca", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of S3 class 'maraca'.}

\item{theme}{Different themes to style the graph. Default style is
"maraca".}

\item{\dots}{not used}
}
\value{
Component plot as a ggplot2 object.
}
