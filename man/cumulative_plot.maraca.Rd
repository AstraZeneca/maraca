\title{Generic function to create a plot showing the components used in
calculating win odds (wins and ties) cumulated for all
outcomes directly from a maraca object.
Note that for this plot, when creating the maraca object using the maraca()
function, the argument "compute_win_odds" has to be set to TRUE.
Check the vignette "Maraca Plots - Plotting win odds" for more details.}
\usage{
\method{cumulative_plot}{maraca}(x, theme = "maraca", reverse = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of S3 class 'maraca'.}

\item{theme}{Choose theme to style the plot. The default theme is "maraca".
Options are "maraca", "color1", "color2" and none".
For more details, check the vignette called
"Maraca Plots - Plotting win odds".}

\item{reverse}{Flag indicating if the cumulated outcomes should be
displayed in order from top to bottom (FALSE, the default)
or in reverse (TRUE).}

\item{\dots}{not used}
}
\value{
Cumulative plot as a patchwork object.
