\alias{component_plot.hce}
\title{Generic function to create a plot showing the components used in
calculating win odds (wins and ties) separately for each
outcome directly from an hce object.
Check the vignette "Maraca Plots - Plotting win odds" for more details.}
\usage{
\method{component_plot}{hce}(
  x,
  continuous_outcome = "C",
  arm_levels = c(active = "A", control = "P"),
  fixed_followup_days = NULL,
  theme = "maraca",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of S3 class 'hce'.}

\item{continuous_outcome}{A single string containing the continuous
outcome label. Default value "C".}

\item{arm_levels}{A named vector of exactly two strings, mapping the
values used for the active and control arms to the values
used in the data. The names must be "active" and "control"
in this order. Note that this parameter only need to
be specified if you have labels different from
 "active" and "control".}

\item{fixed_followup_days}{Not needed if HCE object contains information
on fixed follow-up days in the study
(column PADY or TTEfixed,
depending on hce version).
Otherwise, this argument must be specified.
Note: If argument is specified and HCE object
contains PADY or TTEfixed column, then
fixed_followup_days argument is used.}

\item{theme}{Choose theme to style the plot. The default theme is "maraca".
Options are "maraca", "color1", "color2" and none".
For more details, check the vignette called
"Maraca Plots - Plotting win odds".}

\item{\dots}{not used}
}
\value{
Component plot as a ggplot2 object.
