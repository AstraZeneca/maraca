\title{Generic function to create a mosaic plot that compares outcomes between an
active treatment group and a control group, highlighting areas of "Wins",
"Losses" and "Ties" based on endpoint hierarchy.
Implementation to plot using a maraca object.
Check the vignette "Maraca Plots - Introduction to the Mosaic plot"
for more details.}
\usage{
\method{mosaic_plot}{maraca}(
  x,
  theme = "maraca",
  highlight_ties = FALSE,
  winning_prob = FALSE,
  diagonal_line = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of S3 class 'maraca'.}

\item{theme}{Choose theme to style the plot. The default theme is "maraca".
Options are "maraca", "color1", "color2" and "none".
For more details, check the vignette called
"Maraca Plots - Introduction to the Mosaic plot".}

\item{highlight_ties}{Flag to indicate if component ties should be
highlighted using lighter colors.
Default value: FALSE}

\item{winning_prob}{Flag to indicate if winning probability should be shown
within the plot. Note that in order to display the
winning probability, you need to have set the
"compute_win_odds" to TRUE when creating the maraca
object.
Default value: FALSE}

\item{diagonal_line}{Flag to indicate if diagonal line showing an even
Win/Loss split should be displayed.
Default value: FALSE}

\item{\dots}{not used}
}
\value{
Mosaic plot as a ggplot2 object.
}
