\usage{
maraca(
  data,
  tte_outcomes,
  continuous_outcome,
  arm_levels = c(active = "active", control = "control"),
  column_names = c(outcome = "outcome", arm = "arm", value = "value"),

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with columns for the following information:
- outcome column, containing the time-to-event and continuous
  labels
- arm column, contaning the arm a given row belongs to.
- value column, containing the values.}

\item{tte_outcomes}{A vector of strings containing the time-to-event
outcome labels. The order is kept for the plot.}

\item{continuous_outcome}{A single string containing the continuous
outcome label.}

\item{arm_levels}{A named vector of exactly two strings, mapping the
values used for the active and control arms to the values
used in the data. The names must be "active" and "control"
in this order. Note that this parameter only need to
be specified if you have labels different from
 "active" and "control".}

\item{column_names}{A named vector to map the
outcome, arm, value to the associated column names
in the data. The vector names must match in order "outcome", "arm",
and "value". Note that this parameter only need to be
specified if you have column names different from the ones above.}

\item{fixed_followup_days}{The followup days, or NULL. If NULL, use the
largest value across the hard outcomes.}

\item{compute_win_odds}{If TRUE (default) compute the win odds, otherwise
don't compute them.}
}
