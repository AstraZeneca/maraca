### NOTE 1: Maintainer change 

Monika Huhn (<monika.huhn@astrazeneca.com>) has taken over further development
of the package and because of that will also be maintaining the package going
forward (this has been agreed with former maintainer Stefano Borini -
<stefano.borini@astrazeneca.com>).

### Note 2:

The following NOTE is given when checking on Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64-bit: 

```
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
```
As noted in [R-hub issue #503](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503), this could be due to a bug/crash in MiKTeX and can likely be ignored.
